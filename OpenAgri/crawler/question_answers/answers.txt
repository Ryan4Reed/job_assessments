2.2.1 How many unique ships do we have data on?

    Either of the identifiers named MMSI, Call Sign or IMO can you used to answer this question. 
    Let's use them all and make sure we arive at the same answer in all three cases.

    MMSI: 
        Query used: SELECT DISTINCT COUNT(mmsi) FROM data_science.vessel_info;
        Result: 6828

    Call Sign: 
        Query used: SELECT DISTINCT COUNT(call_sign) FROM data_science.vessel_info;
        Result: 6828

    IMO: 
        Query used: SELECT DISTINCT COUNT(IMO) FROM data_science.vessel_info;
        Result: 6828


2.2.2 At present, we have data on numerous container ships. How many of these ships would be
classified as ULCV?

    My first step in answering this question was to see if a lable related to ULCV was present in the
    detailed_type column of the vessel_info table. But the following query: 
        
        SELECT DISTINCT detailed_type FROM data_science.vessel_info;
    
    Returned the following results which did not contain such a lable:
        
        Tug/Supply Vessel
        Yacht
        Cargo/Containership
        Fishery Patrol Vessel
        Ro-Ro/Container Carrier
        Heavy Load Carrier
        Reefer
        High Speed Craft
        Anchor Handling Vessel
        Ro-Ro/Passenger Ship
        Vehicles Carrier
        Platform
        General Cargo
        Offshore Supply Ship
        Deck Cargo Ship
        Hopper Dredger
        Oil Products Tanker
        Sailing Vessel
        LNG Tanker
        Cement Carrier
        Crane Ship
        Oil/Chemical Tanker
        Livestock Carrier
        Trenching Support Vessel
        LPG Tanker
        Patrol Vessel
        Bulk Carrier
        Crude Oil Tanker
        Ro-Ro Cargo
        Tug
        Reefer/Containership
        Container Ship
        Fire Fighting Vessel
        Passenger Ship
        Chemical Tanker

    My next strategy was to see if we could use the vessel characteristics available in the database 
    (gross tonnage, DWT, length, and width) to classify a vessel as ULCV. From my research, the 
    classification of a ship as ULCV is primarily determined by its carrying capacity in terms of 
    Twenty-foot Equivalent Units (TEUs), which is the standard measure used for capacity in container 
    transportation. Typically, ships with a capacity of over 10,000 or 14,000 TEUs (depending on the 
    definition used) are considered ULCVs.

    Unfortunately, the vessel characteristics in the table do not directly translate into TEUs, as 
    the ability of a ship to carry containers also depends on its design. As a result, there's no 
    straightforward formula to accurately calculate TEU capacity from these metrics. 
    It seems that additional data is required to answer this question.

2.2.3 After analyzing the 'ports' table, you noticed that erroneous information has been entered into
the 'code' column. Utilizing an alternative column in the table, retrieve a list of rows where most
'code' values are incorrect.

    On first investigation of the ports table I noticed that some of the entries in the code column 
    numeric sequences instead of letter sequences. As a result my first impression was that these were 
    the incorrect entries. But then I read the question again and you request that we use another 
    column in the table to identify the incorrect code values. 

    So I had a look and the only usable pattern I could identify was that it seemed that the first 
    letters in the letter sequence of the code column should match the letter sequence in the country 
    code column. To investigate whether there were letter sequences, other then the numeric sequences 
    that did not match the country_code sequence in this way I executed the following query:
        
        SELECT *
        FROM data_science.vessel_ports
        WHERE SUBSTRING(code FROM 1 FOR CHAR_LENGTH(country_code)) <> country_code;'
    
    On investigating the results I did indeed find a couple of entries where the first letters in the 
    sequence of the code column did not match the first letters of the sequence in the country_code
    column:
        port                                    country         latitude    longitude   code    maxe_ships  country_code
        ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        GIMBOA (Offshore Terminal)	            Bahamas (BS)	-7.542833	12.16867	AOGIM	  0.0	    BS
        SERPENTINA TERMINAL (Offshore Terminal)	Bahamas (BS)	3.802688	8.075488	GQSER	  2.0	    BS
        OYO (Offshore Terminal)	                Panama (PA)	    2.6939575	2.295729	NGOYO	  0.0	    PA
        YUUM KAKNAAB (Offshore Terminal)	    Singapore (SG)	19.60221	-92.29489	MXYKN	  5.0	    SG
    
    However, I went to check, and these codes are in fact correct. The pattern I suspected just isn't 
    valid. As a result, I returned to my original analysis that the incorrect entries where the 
    numeric sequences. In which case we need not use an alternative column to identify them. The
    following query will suffice:
        
        SELECT *
        FROM data_science.vessel_ports
        WHERE code ~ '^[0-9]+$';

    Here is an exert of the results:
        port                country             latitude    longitude   code    maxe_ships  country_code
